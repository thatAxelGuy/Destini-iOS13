# Destini – Interactive Story App  
*A branching narrative experiment to learn Swift, Xcode, and app architecture*

## 🎯 Learning Goals  

Through this project, I set out to:  

- **Learn the basics of Swift and Xcode** by building a working iOS app from scratch.  
- **Understand app architecture and data flow**, specifically how to structure branching story data (title, choices, destinations).  
- **Practice conditionals and state management** by implementing logic that changes based on user input.  
- **Work with iOS UI components** and connect them to the underlying game logic.  
- **Build coding discipline** by writing clean, readable code and thinking about scalability.

## 🕹️ The App  

The app is a lightweight interactive narrative where the user selects between two choices at each step, leading to different storylines and endings.  

The quirky and dark humor of the story was part of the fun—it helped me test and confirm that the branching logic was working as intended.

## 🚀 Next Steps / Possible Improvements  

If I were to expand on this project, I’d like to:  

- **Add a save system** so players can return to past choices.  
- **Load story data dynamically** from JSON or a database instead of hardcoding.  
- **Improve UI/UX** with animations, transitions, and custom styling.  
- **Refactor for scalability**, enabling easy addition of new branching paths.  
- **Explore portability**, applying the same branching narrative structure in Unity for cross-platform prototypes.

## 📖 Context  

This project is part of my broader journey in strengthening my programming skills alongside my background in **game design and systems implementation**. While small in scope, it represents a step in connecting narrative design, logic structuring, and technical implementation.
